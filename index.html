            <p>Efo Riro is a rich vegetable soup and a very popular in the Yoruba area in Nigeria. This is one of my best recipes and it is one of my favorite Nigerian soups because of its health benefits... It’s <strong>stressless with low time and great reuslt</strong>: just a handful of Iru (locust beans), crayfish, ginger & garlic and other spices gives it the most incredible flavour.</p>

            <p><strong> Efo riro is a one-pot stew with layers of flavor. When Efo riro is cooking, the aroma is always fascinating <i> very attractive</i></strong>. Very Attractive!!!
